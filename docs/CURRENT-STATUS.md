## Deployed state

The August 9 release wave is complete. Pull requests
[#95](https://github.com/roblebaegaming/DraftCenter/pull/95) through
[#99](https://github.com/roblebaegaming/DraftCenter/pull/99) shipped, in order:

- standalone tournaments scaled to 512 single-elimination or 256
  double-elimination entrants;
- 16-player Draft Tournaments with registration, check-in, a hidden event
  draft, roster snapshots and locks, Swiss rounds, corrections, and an optional
  2/4/8-player top cut;
- Pokémon Connections and the four-game Daily Games experience, including
  completion-gated discussions and updated badges;
- private Nuzlocke Run Card saves in My Teams, profile-linked encounter
  artwork, and branded PNG exports; and
- a persistent, accessible Draft Home action in the global sticky header.

The evidence-led product-alignment SEO release also shipped through pull
request [#101](https://github.com/roblebaegaming/DraftCenter/pull/101). The
public tournament landing now covers single elimination, double elimination,
Draft Tournaments, and connected championships with current metadata,
structured data, server-readable guidance, and internal links. Daily Games FAQ
content and structured data now cover completion-gated discussions, and the
sitemap and `llms.txt` reflect the current public products. Tournament and
organization detail workspaces, My Teams, and saved Nuzlocke Run Cards remain
non-indexed and outside the sitemap.

The consolidated discovery, pricing, and pod-access release shipped through
pull request [#103](https://github.com/roblebaegaming/DraftCenter/pull/103).
The public Pokédex now has combinable color, Egg Group, and shape filters plus
42 canonical category routes. Draft commissioners can opt into sourced,
versioned pricing boards with explicit BST estimates and provenance, while
existing leagues retain their stored pricing. Managers may visit sibling pods
to follow activity, use the League Board, and predict without receiving team,
transaction, claim, trade, draft, or direct-message authority; spectators
remain limited to standings, predictions, the official draft board, and
playoffs.

The crawl-integrity follow-up shipped through pull request
[#106](https://github.com/roblebaegaming/DraftCenter/pull/106). It repairs the
live Paldean Tauros 404 and redirecting tournament links, gives ambiguous
Meowstic and Zygarde forms unique public metadata, replaces invalid Nuzlocke
software rich-result markup with accurate page/article data, shortens the
flagged titles, and server-renders direct links to eligible public leagues.
The GitHub security-email finding was also confirmed as an already-remediated
false positive involving public catalog provenance hashes; the regression
fixture now covers the exact allowlist paths.

Migrations 361-368 are applied to the exact core production project. The
previous multi-pod organization, qualification, and connected championship
release remains live through migrations 350-360 and production record pull
request [#94](https://github.com/roblebaegaming/DraftCenter/pull/94).

## Release verification

- The complete application tests, National Dex verification across 1,027
  rows, production dependency audit, and production builds passed for the
  applicable releases.
- The destructive tournament, Draft Tournament, Daily Games, and Nuzlocke
  database matrices passed only in the isolated Supabase Preview environment.
- Protected pull-request security, dependency, secret-scan, CodeQL, and Vercel
  checks passed for the release pull requests.
- Signed-in Preview walkthroughs covered the new database-backed workflows.
- The SEO release passed all protected security, dependency, secret-scan,
  CodeQL, and Vercel checks. Its exact Preview passed desktop and 390px mobile
  review without browser errors or horizontal overflow.
- Pull request #103 passed protected security, dependency, full-history secret
  scan, CodeQL, and Vercel checks. Its exact Preview and production deployment
  passed desktop and 390px mobile Pokédex review without browser errors or
  horizontal overflow. The retained Supabase Preview observer-access matrix
  passed every RLS, grant, allow, denial, full-staff, and cleanup assertion.
- Vercel reports exact `main` application commit `838f8a8` Ready and Current on
  the public production domains.
- The signed-out production smoke sweep passes, including protected 401
  boundaries. Focused live checks also pass for tournament metadata and JSON-LD,
  Daily Games FAQ structured data, sitemap modification dates, `llms.txt`, and
  private-route `noindex` behavior. The new color, Egg Group, and shape category
  routes also return their expected canonical metadata and structured data,
  combine correctly in the directory, and appear in the production sitemap.
- Pull request #106 passed all protected checks. Its exact Preview and live
  production pages passed focused canonical, title, JSON-LD, redirect,
  `nofollow`, and direct-link checks. The signed-out production smoke sweep
  passed after deployment, including every protected 401 boundary.
- No merge protection was bypassed.

## Preserved boundaries

- No real league, draft, roster, tournament, Daily Games discussion, saved
  team, provider setting, or production account was changed to test the
  releases.
- Disposable Preview fixtures were removed by exact recorded identifiers.
- The release-wave Preview branch remains available for owner-approved
  cleanup. The retained `multi-pod-pr-82` Preview branch must not be deleted.
- The original DraftCenter workspace's pre-existing changes remain unstaged
  and untouched.
- No production provider configuration, environment variable, or secret was
  changed.

## Remaining work

No application or documentation release described above remains to be pushed.
Continue normal monitoring of the tournament, Daily Games, Nuzlocke,
navigation, pricing, pod-observer, metadata, and indexing paths.

Repeat the comparable 5,000-page crawl after production cache replacement.
Use roughly August 23 for the early Search Console read and September 6 for the
normal 28-day content/indexing decision. Redirect, alternate-canonical, and
intentional `noindex` examples should not be treated as defects merely because
Search Console excludes them.
